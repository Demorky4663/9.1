  Ningbo City Vocational and technical college was founded in 2003. Its predecessor is the College of Vocational and technical education of Ningbo University. It is a full-time ordinary higher vocational college for training high-quality technical and skilled applied talents for modern service industry. In 1992, Mr. Shao Yifu donated money to build the former Ningbo Normal University "Yifu higher vocational and technical education center", which is one of the earliest institutions to carry out full-time higher vocational and technical education in Zhejiang Province. In 1996, the former Ningbo University, the former Ningbo Normal University and the former Ningbo Branch of Zhejiang Fisheries University merged to form a new Ningbo University and set up the College of Vocational and technical education of Ningbo University. In 2000, the former Ningbo ocean School of the State Oceanic Administration and the former Ningbo Forestry School of the State Forestry Administration were incorporated into Ningbo University. The majors and personnel of the former Ningbo forestry school and some majors and personnel of the former Ningbo ocean school were transferred to the vocational education college. In 2003, the provincial government approved the establishment of an independent Ningbo City Vocational and technical college on the basis of the Vocational Education College of Ningbo University.
